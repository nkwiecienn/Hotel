Hotel Management System

This program is designed for hotel management. The initial configuration is loaded from a CSV file. This is my first simple Java program.

This is a program for hotel registration. Upon execution, the following commands are possible:

list: Lists all room numbers.
view: Prompts for a room number and then displays information about it.
checkin: Allows guest registration in a room. The program prompts for the room number, then requests guest information, and marks the room as occupied.
checkout: Prompts for a room number and then checks out the guest from it.
listall: Lists all information about the rooms.
save: Saves the current hotel state.
exit: Terminates the program.

The initial hotel configuration is located in the roomsCVS.cvs file in the resources folder.
